  <h1>About Myles</h1>
  <p>Welcome, reader. My name is Myles Hathcock, this is my personal site
  dedicated to primarily technical topics in programming, computer science,
  engineering, and associated fields. I currently work as an engineer at a
  proprietary trading firm based out of Chicago. I focus mostly on designing
  and implementing systems that process large amounts of data.</p>
  <p>Beyond my work in the tech sector, I enjoy
  spending time with my family and am an avid runner. Please feel free to reach
  out to me with questions or comments on twitter or email or have a look at my
  open-source projects: Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/my1es">@__my1es</a>,
  GitHub <a href="https://github.com/my1es">@my1es</a>, and email
  <a href="mailto:m.hathcock@gmail.com">m.hathcock@gmail.com</a>.</p>
