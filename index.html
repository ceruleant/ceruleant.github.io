<article>
  <p>Welcome, reader. I am a software engineer residing
  in Chicago, Illinois, USA. I currently work in FinTech, but have experience
  in the Aerospace industry as well, which is what my formal education is in.</p>
  <p>I have 10+ years of experience building high performance software (and
  occasionally hardware) systems. This includes primarily C++ applications involving
  strict latency requirements, high throughput requirements, and requiring careful
  design of data structures, engineering processes, and more.</p>
  <p>I regularly work with a variety of programming languages, though my favorites
  when not subject to other constraints are probably Rust, Python, and Typescript. My hobbies include (work related) compression, distributed systems, and hardware design. Other (not work-related) hobbies include running/exercising, cooking, and singing (poorly).</p>
  <p>Please enjoy my collection of projects on <a href="https://github.com/ceruleant">GitHub</a>, reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/c3ruleant">@c3ruleant</a>, or <a href="mailto:c3ruleant@gmail.com">email me!</a> I'm friendly (I think) and I enjoy talking.</p>
